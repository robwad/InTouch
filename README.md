# InTouch

This is an Ionic mobile app for Android and iOS that I recently built for a company called Mainspring Technology. 
It is implemented with Firebase's Firestore, Google Cloud Functions, cordova and the angularfire and firebasex packages.

It allows members to subscribe to various groups within their organization and for the organization to configure the groups and send push notifications to the mobiles of the subscribed members.

# InTouch

This is an Ionic app for Android and iOS that I recently built for a company called Mainspring Technology. 
It is implemented with Firebase's Firestore, Google Cloud Functions, cordova and the angularfire and firebasex packages.

It allows members to subscribe to various groups within their organization and for the organization to 
then send notifications to the subscribed members.

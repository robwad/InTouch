# InTouch

This is a multilingual Ionic mobile app for Android and iOS that I recently built for a company called Mainspring Technology. 
It is implemented with Firebase's NoSQL Firestore as the backend, Google Cloud Functions for certain controller functions, Apache Cordova for cross-platform compatability, and the angularfire and firebasex packages.

It allows members to subscribe to various groups within their organization and for the organization to configure the groups and send push notifications to the subscribed members.
